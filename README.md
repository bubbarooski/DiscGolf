# Disc Golf - Analyzing my Game
One of my favorite hobbies is the sport of disc golf! For those that dont know, disc golf is very similar to standard golf but rather than hitting a ball with a club and aiming to get it into the hole, a player throws different discs with the goal of getting it into a basket. Scoring works the same (birdie, par, bogey, etc.) and has a lot of the same rules regarding the teepad, the green, pace of play, out of bounds, etc.

Like any other sport, lots of analytics can be gathered to determine where a player is the strongest or where they need to improve the most. This repo will be the central hub for where I will keep any and all things related to this project.


# Outline
There are a couple different layers to this project that I will be exploring and they are broken down below:
  - Database: using Microsoft SQL Server, I will create and mantain a small database of all of my rounds and the different courses I have played. This will allow me to keep all rounds in one place and allow me to query for specific rounds, holes, etc. This database will be normalized to 3NF and will have its own folder.
