# Disc Golf - Analyzing my Game
One of my favorite hobbies is the sport of disc golf! For those that dont know, disc golf is very similar to standard golf but rather than hitting a ball with a club and aiming to get it into the hole, a player throws different discs with the goal of getting it into a basket. Scoring works the same (birdie, par, bogey, etc.) and has a lot of the same rules regarding the teepad, the green, pace of play, out of bounds, etc.
Like any other sport, lots of analytics can be gathered to determine where a player is the strongest or where they need to improve the most.
